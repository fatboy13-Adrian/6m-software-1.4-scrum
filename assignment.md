### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

By implementing scrum, it can enhance productivity of the IT team in a startup school by fostering better collaboration, set clear goals and adaptability. 
This will help the school's IT team to operate more efficiently, deliver solution faster and adapt to changing of needs, which is critical in our fast paced and evolving field of education.

Below are how I will implement scrum to help the IT team to improve on their productivity:

Foster better collaboration
- Scrum encourages daily stand - up meetings whereby teammates discuss their work progress, challenges faced and plans for the day.
- Such open communication ensures the IT team is aligned to avoid misunderstanding and foster team work within the organization.

Set clear goals
- Through sprint planning, IT team can breakdown large projects into smaller, and managable tasks such as setting up of school network or deployment of e-learning webpages.
- Clarity will help the team to prioritize their tasks and focus on delivering value on an incremental basis.

Adaptability
- By using scrum's iterative approach, it allows IT team to regularly review and adjust their plans so that they can respond effectively to new requirements or challenges like a sudden need to setup an online learning platform.

Continuous improvement (CI)
- Sprint retrospective at end of each iteration allows the IT team to reflect on what was done well and what can be improve upon.
- This would provide constant feedback loops that promotes learning and enhancing efficiency over time.

Customer - centric approach
- Scrum emphasizes on delivering functional increments on a regular basis, which ensures that all stakeholders receive usable outputs and provide feedback.
- It will help IT team to focus on meeting the actual needs within the project.
